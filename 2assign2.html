</ol>
<p><strong>1A. SELECTED METHODOLOGY: QUALITATIVE RISK
ASSESSMENT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Justifications</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Familiarity and Simplicity</strong>: This uses a simple and
intuitive approach to identify risks based on the severity and
likelihood of their occurrence, which is suitable for a business with
simple computer systems.</p>
<p><strong>Resource Availability</strong>: The business is small and has
limited staff, so a qualitative approach can be effectively implemented
without needing specialised risk assessment skills.</p>
<p><strong>Relevance</strong>: It focuses on the most visible risks
(theft, damage, data loss on single devices, etc.), which are more
applicable to a business of this scale and nature.</p>
<p><strong>Key Steps:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Identify Assets</strong>: Physical inventory, warehouse
management system (old computer with spreadsheet), sales computer,
wireless network.</p>
<p><strong>Identify Threats</strong>: Theft, data loss, physical damage,
unauthorised access (cyber and physical).</p>
<p><strong>Identify Vulnerabilities</strong>: Lack of data backups,
outdated software, minimal cybersecurity measures.</p>
<p><strong>Assess Risks</strong>: Using a risk matrix to prioritise
risks based on their potential impact and likelihood.</p>
<p><strong>1B. THREAT MODELLING TECHNIQUE USED IS STRIDE.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Spoofing</strong>: An attacker makes a fake email to order
goods.</p>
<p>             Qualitative risk assessment: likelihood: high; impact:
high</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Tampering</strong>: An attacker hacks a shop's computers
through WIFI and then amends payment information.</p>
<p>             Qualitative risk assessment: likelihood: high; impact:
extremely high</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Repudiation</strong>: An attacker clears the shop's computer
system and security logs.</p>
<p>             Qualitative risk assessment: likelihood: medium impact:
extremely high</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Information Disclosure:</strong> A staff member steals
customers' private information and exposes it to others.</p>
<p>             Qualitative risk assessment: likelihood: extremely high;
impact: extremely high</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Denial of Service</strong>: An attacker launches multiple
simultaneous large requests to access WIFI, which causes the network to
crash.</p>
<p>             Qualitative risk assessment: likelihood: high; impact:
high</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Elevation of Privilege:</strong> A staff member logs in as a
general user and then gains the right to privilege.</p>
<p>             Qualitative risk assessment: likelihood: low; impact:
high</p>
<p><strong>1C.</strong> <strong>THESE MITIGATING STRATEGIES ARE CREATED
IN CONSIDERATION OF ISO27001, NIST AND PCI-DSS AND ARE
RISK-BASED.</strong></p>
<p>Access control: appropriate controls, policies, and procedures would
be established for access, account management, access enforcement,
information flow enforcement, etc. Appropriate segregation of duties and
the concept of least privilege will be enforced. Unsuccessful log-ins
would be recorded.</p>
<p>Intrusion detection and prevention systems will be installed, the
website will be monitored, and firewalls will be installed to maintain
data security.</p>
<p>Perimeter firewalls shall be installed between wireless networks and
other sensitive information networks. Firewall and router rule sets
policies are reviewed every six months.</p>
<p>Secured payment gateway through which transactions to be submitted to
financial networks for authorisation and settlement be installed.</p>
<p>Disaster Recovery Planning: maintain adequate procedures and
information to ensure a successful disaster recovery operation.</p>
<p>Periodically apply patches for malware/antivirus signature updates,
critical system bug fixes, etc.</p>
<p>Encryption protocols and encryption key management will be
employed.</p>
<p>Compliance security audits and penetration tests would be performed
regularly.</p>
<p><strong>2A. SELECTED METHODOLOGY: QUALITATIVE RISK
ASSESSMENT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Justifications</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Identify the Most Critical Risk</strong>: Identify critical
risks quickly over complex transformed digital systems without too much
burden of complex analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Easy to understand</strong>: With the possibility of
investment from Orla O'dour, we will need an easy-to-understand risk
assessment and effective presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Key Steps:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Identify Assets</strong>: E-commerce platform, digital data
storage (cloud-based), expanded wireless networks, and mobile
applications for staff and customers.</p>
<p><strong>Identify Threats</strong>: Cyberattacks, data breaches,
system failures, supply chain attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Identify Vulnerabilities:</strong> Insufficient cybersecurity
measures, reliance on third-party platforms, inadequate staff training
in cybersecurity.</p>
<p><strong>Assess Risks</strong>: Calculate the potential financial
impact of each risk and its probability, allowing for budget allocation
to mitigate high-priority risks.</p>
<p><strong>2B. ADOPTING CLOUD COMPUTING</strong></p>
<p>A cloud-based solution would form digitalisation, including an
e-commerce portal (website), online digital marketing, and blogs.
However, an ERP system will not be implemented now as SAP Hanna is
extremely expensive and unsuitable for such a small retail
operation.</p>
<p><strong>2C. STRIDE AGAIN IS USED</strong></p>
<p><strong>Spoofing</strong>: A staff member receives a faking email
requesting credential authentication for the cloud platform.</p>
<p>             Qualitative risk assessment: likelihood: low; impact:
medium</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Tampering</strong>: An attacker injects malicious code into
the shop's application, which continues to collect membership
information.</p>
<p>             Qualitative risk assessment: likelihood: very low;
impact: medium</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Repudiation</strong>: An attacker clears the cloud platform's
computer system and security logs.</p>
<p>             Qualitative risk assessment: likelihood: extremely low;
impact: high</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Information Disclosure:</strong> An attacker kidnaps the
customers' data and sells it.</p>
<p>             Qualitative risk assessment: likelihood: low; impact:
very high</p>
<p><strong>Denial of Service:</strong> An attacker makes multiple
requests to register membership, which causes a slow response.</p>
<p>             Qualitative risk assessment: likelihood: low; impact:
medium</p>
<p><strong>Elevation of Privilege:</strong> An attacker gains
unauthorised access by the cloud or system platform vulnerability.</p>
<p>             Qualitative risk assessment: likelihood: extremely low;
impact: high</p>
<p><strong>2E. THE RISK MITIGATION STRATEGY FOR
DIGITALISATION.</strong></p>
<p>Data security strategies would include the following toolsets and
technologies: Encryption, Hashing, Key management, Tokenization, Data
loss prevention, Data de-identification, etc. (Carter, 2023, p. 96)</p>
<p>Automation in the cloud is applied to the implementation of security.
Base images of virtual hosts that have already been hardened and scanned
are used to auto-scale and expand. The same framework and methodology
are applied to cloud patching and updating. (Carter, 2023, p. 153)</p>
<p>The mitigation for cloud risks would focus on these areas: Physical
and environmental protection, System, storage and communication
protection, Virtualization systems protection, Identification,
authentication, and authorisation in cloud infrastructure, Audit
mechanisms and Planned Business Continuity and disaster recovery.
(Carter, 2023, p.154-162)</p>
<p><strong>3. RECOMMENDATIONS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Digitalisation should be carried out. This is because
digitalisation will enable the business to internationalise and reach
global customers, as per the Irish investor’s aspirations.</p></li>
<li><p>Since the company is based in the United States, it should adopt
cybersecurity risk assessment frameworks like the Payment Card Industry
Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), NIST, and STRIDE, which should be
utilised for the risk assessment.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a need to carry out the chain risk management assessment
to ensure the safety of products through the entire process from
manufacturer to consumer.</p></li>
<li><p>Since the business is based in the US, it should follow the
California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act data
breach notification. However, it should follow the EU General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) as a guideline for the classification and
management of business data.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a need to ensure that organisational measures, technical
measures, policies and procedures, access control and system management,
asset management, business continuity plans, BYOD, remote access, breach
policy, data retention, data erasure, internet usage, outsourcing,
information security and internal audit policies are put in place to
reduce and management cybersecurity risks.     </p></li>
<li><p>The business should adopt cloud-computing services and integrate
all services, from placing online orders on the company website to
in-person shopping, billing, taxation, customer delivery, and supply
chain integration. </p></li>

<h2>Individual Project: Executive Summary</h2>
<p>In this essay, the food quality and supply chain problems for the pet
food company would be first analyzed with the TOPSIS method and the
solution would be found with online software. Secondly, the summary of
the results and the recommendations on the quality and supply chain
problems would be presented. Lastly, the disaster recovery and cloud
vendor lock-in issues would be discussed.</p>
<p><strong>1.a.</strong> The Technique for Order Preference by
Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), a type of multi-criteria
decision making (MCDM) methods, is selected. Justification for the
TOPSIS method includes its “simplicity, rationality, comprehensibility,
good computational efficiency and ability to measure the relative
performance for each alternative in a simple mathematical form.”
(Roszkowska, 2011) The online software company called onlineoutput.com’s
web-based software has been used to perform the actual calculations.</p>
<p><strong>1.b.</strong> For the criteria in food quality, it is taken
from a study done by Greda (2009):</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 19%" />
<col style="width: 60%" />
<col style="width: 19%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Criterion</th>
<th>Problem (to be spent resources on)</th>
<th>Probability</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>1</td>
<td>Difficulties to buy raw materials with specific parameters (i.e.
seasonal variability of the product quality, cheaper supplier)</td>
<td>0.1516</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>2</td>
<td>Irregularity of supply of raw materials</td>
<td>0.0343</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>3</td>
<td>Inappropriate selection and quality of packaging materials</td>
<td>0.1400</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>4</td>
<td>Instable quality of the produced goods</td>
<td>0.6741</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For the criteria in the supply chain, it is taken from website called
The Geography of Transport Systems by Dr. Jean-Paul Rodrigue (2024). The
probabilities have been adjusted from the original source:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 22%" />
<col style="width: 43%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Criterion</th>
<th>Problem (to be spent resources on)</th>
<th>Probability</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>1</td>
<td>Political instability</td>
<td>0.22</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>2</td>
<td>Trade restrictions</td>
<td>0.40</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>3</td>
<td>Demand shocks</td>
<td>0.25</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>4</td>
<td>Price volatility</td>
<td>0.13</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For both quality and supply chain, the alternatives represent
different combinations of resources/efforts spent on different criteria
(issues). For example, in quality, alternative #1 consists of 1 for
criterion #1, 2 for criterion #2, 3 for criterion #3, 4 for criterion
#4; that actually means 10% of the company’s resources/efforts to be
spent on issue of quality dealing with difficulties to buy raw materials
with specific parameters, 20% of the company’s resources/efforts to be
spent on dealing with irregularity of supply of raw materials, 30% spent
on dealing with inappropriate selection and quality of packaging
materials, 40% spent on dealing with instable quality of the produced
goods.</p>
<p>Another example, in supply chain alternative #2 consists of 1 for
criterion #1, 3 for criterion #2, 5 for criterion #3, 1 for criterion
#4; that actually means 10% of the company’s resources/efforts to be
spent on supply chain dealing with political instability, 30% of the
company’s resources/efforts to be spent on dealing with trade
restrictions, 50% spent on dealing with demand shocks, 10% spent on
dealing with price volatility.</p>
<p><strong>1.c.</strong> For quality, the result is that alternative 1
(10% of resources/efforts for this issue spent on difficulty with raw
materials, 20% on irregularity in supply, 30% on problems with
packaging, 40% on instable quality problem) ranks highest and should be
chosen.</p>
<p>For supply chain, the result is that alternative 2 (10% of
resources/efforts for this issue spent on political instability, 30% on
trade restrictions, 50% on demand shocks, 10% on price volatility) ranks
highest.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>For product quality</strong>, the MCDM
TOPSIS has suggested that 10% of the company’s resources/efforts to be
spent on food quality dealing with difficulties to buy raw materials
with specific parameters (e.g. quality). The company could be
recommended to spend a little bit more to engage in long-term agreements
with a better, bigger, more stable raw material suppliers that can
support stable raw materials with stable parameters. The probability of
this risk occurring is 15.16%.</p>
<p>The computer software solution also suggests that and 20% of the
company’s resources/efforts to be spent on food quality dealing with
irregularity of supply of raw materials (i.e. variable amount of
agricultural goods dependent upon the yields). The company could be
recommended that it is to spend 20% of its resources to also buy the
necessary agricultural raw material in the futures market in order to
lock in the future supply of necessary amount of such goods. The
probability of this risk occurring is 3.43%.</p>
<p>The computer software solution also suggests that and 30% of the
company’s resources/efforts to be spent on food quality dealing with
inappropriate selection and quality of packaging materials. The company
should perhaps spend 30% of its efforts on selecting the right quality
and selection of packaging materials. The probability of this risk
occurring is 14%.</p>
<p>The TOSIS software solution also suggests that and 40% of the
company’s resources/efforts to be spent on food quality dealing with the
instable quality of the produced goods problem. The company perhaps
should therefore spend more on preservative additive to the produced pet
food product, not to the extend that would affect the quality of the pet
food, that is. The probability of this risk occurring is 67.41%.</p>
<p><strong>As for the supply chain</strong>, the MCDM TOPSIS has
suggested that 10% of the company’s resources/efforts on this supply
chain project to be spent on dealing with geopolitical instability.
PriceWaterhouseCooper (Mahapatra, 2023) has suggested to 1. identify
geopolitical turmoil and anticipate business risks, 2. diversify and
stay resilience, 3. assess risk proactively and plan scenarios, 4.
leverage technology and gain data driven insights, and 5. Collaborate in
a manner intra and intercompany. It is therefore recommended to spend
small amount of money to hire this consulting firm to solve the issue.
The probability of this risk occurring is 22%.</p>
<p>The computer software solution also suggests that and 30% of the
company’s resources/efforts on this issue to be spent on dealing with
trade restrictions. Switzerland global enterprise (Reinarz, 2018) has
the following advice: 1. Prepare seriously for market entry, 2. Make the
most of the free trade agreements, and 3. Seek professional support. It
is therefore recommended that a professional consultant is engaged. The
probability of this risk occurring is 40%.</p>
<p>The computer software solution also suggests that and 50% of the
company’s resources/efforts on this issue to be spent on dealing with
the problem of demand shocks. Bettiol and others (2023) have suggested
that SMEs should respond to exogenous shocks by diversification,
servitization and digitalization. This is almost exactly what the pet
food company is trying to do by diversifying into international audience
and going digital. It is very encouraging that the direction this
company is taking is affirmed in a published journal. The probability of
this risk occurring is 25%.</p>
<p>The computer software solution also suggests that and 10% of the
company’s resources/efforts on this issue to be spent on dealing with
the price volatility problem. It is therefore the pet food company spend
just a little bit more on looking into the public future markets and the
private exchanges to lock in input prices and engages in long term
agreements with large distributors (customers) to lock in product price
in order to solve the price volatility problem. The probability of this
risk occurring is 13%</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Disaster recovery strategy and vendor lock-in</p>
<p><strong>Putting into place a business continuity / disaster recovery
(DR) strategy</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, the pet food company would perform a risk assessment since
it needs to understand the unique set of threats and vulnerabilities
specific to this company so that it can likely to succeed in
implementing an effective DR strategy. (Snedaker, 2013, p. 451)</p>
<p>Secondly, the company would perform an impact analysis on itself. It
needs to quantify the impact of an unplanned outages to the company’s
bottom line or reputation, then it would proceed to determine the DR
requirements, knowing the correct budget for implementing a recovery
strategy. (Snedaker, 2013, p. 451)</p>
<p>Thirdly, it needs to determine its DR requirements. Requirements such
as MTD, WRT, RTO and RPO need to be fully understood for all IT systems
and data before deciding on an appropriate recovery strategy. The
company needs to know what the real requirements are, otherwise it will
fail at DR planning and spend too much or too little on protecting its
IT assets. (Snedaker, 2013, p. 452)</p>
<p>Fourthly, for reason given below in the next section, online,
specifically cloud based, DR strategy is engaged and the company can and
should therefore put in place a robust DR plan, with the involvement of
the cloud service provider (CSP). Since the pet food company’s critical
operations would be dependent on cloud-based platforms, it needs to make
sure a disruption in cloud services will not impact the operational
resilience. Deficiencies identified would need to be addressed as soon
as possible. The pet food company should also have comprehensive
understanding of its CSP’s resilience capabilities, including the CSP’s
contingency plans and procedures. The pet food company should also
ensure these plans and procedures are subject to regular drills and
effective testing. (Hong Kong Monetary Authority, 2022)</p>
<p><strong>The DR solution that would lose no more than 1 minute of data
loss</strong></p>
<p>As it turns out, the best on premise DR solution would take minutes,
many, many minutes of RTO+RPO, which is not acceptable to the investor,
and therefore, the only plausible solution candidates can be found
online, in the cloud.</p>
<p>Since the Microsoft Azure documentation is found to be wanting by
this student, the primary focus would therefore concentrate on AWS
services. The investor makes the job of evaluation of candidates very
simple for this student by requiring no more than 1 minute of data loss.
There is only one candidate left standing to do that job, namely,
“Multi-site active/active”, or multiple active sites. The next candidate
in the AWS world is the “Warm standby”, which is unacceptable to the
investor because it has a RPO/RTO in “minutes”, which is much longer
than the required “one minute”, whereas “Multi-site active/active” has a
RPO/RTO of “real time” or “zero down time” and “near zero data
loss”.</p>
<p><strong>Chosen platform to host the solution</strong></p>
<p>The actual architecture is such that the pet shop would be running
its IT services in the AWS cloud “active” in multiple regions;
therefore, at least two regions. “This approach is the most complex and
costly approach to disaster recovery, but it can reduce your recovery
time to near zero for most disasters with the correct technology choices
and implementation.” (AWS Documentation)</p>
<p>Since the workload is running in more than one region, it is not a
failover scenario. Regular backups are still required and would be
tested regularly. Both Amazon Route 53 and AWS Global Accelerator
services would enable the definition of policies that determine which
users go to which active regional endpoint. Asynchronous data
replication with this strategy enables near-zero RPO. AWS services like
Amazon Aurora global database use dedicated infrastructure that makes
the pet shop’s databases entirely available to serve its application,
and can replicate to up to five secondary Region with typical latency of
under a second. (AWS Documentation)</p>
<p><strong>Advice on vendor lock-in</strong></p>
<p><u>Well-informed decision making</u></p>
<p>According to research performed by Opara-Martins, Sahandi, and Tian
(2016), it would appear that “the vetting process for selecting vendors
is a critical aspect for effective cloud migration with minimized risk
of lock-in.” Also, the pet food company should “focus on constantly
monitoring any development or changes in the cloud that may impact data
security or hinder interoperability and portability.”</p>
<p><u>Standards and cloud-based solutions</u></p>
<p>According to Opara-Martins, Sahandi, and Tian (2016), cloud service
providers are aware that standardization in the clouds would let cloud
customers easier to leave. “Many cloud providers are concerned with the
loss of customer that may come with standardization initiatives which
may flatten profits, and do not regard the solution favorable.” These
authors therefore suggests that it is up to businesses to be aware that
decisions to adopt or move resources to the cloud requires adequate risk
analysis for potential of lock-ins. In other words, businesses need to
think very, very carefully before they sign the contract to get on the
cloud.</p>
<p><u>Stakeholder engagement</u></p>
<p>The Quixy editorial team (2024) suggests that understanding the
particular risks related to a particular cloud service provider lock-in
calls for stakeholder engagement. Dialogue leaded by the leaders must
get all other stakeholders in the organization to realize the benefits
and risks of getting on the cloud and cloud lock-ins. Also, “in making
technical choices, architects and technical groups need to remember the
commercial enterprise implications.” In any case, they need to think
very carefully before getting on the cloud.</p>
<p><u>Consider upgrading before migration</u></p>
<p>Is moving to the cloud absolutely necessary? Is it possible to
upgrade and improve on the existing IT infrastructures in the company?
(Quixy editorial team, 2024) The pet food company needs to ask such
questions.</p>
<p><u>Develop a multi-cloud approach</u></p>
<p>Using two or more public clouds simultaneously is becoming
increasingly popular, according to the Quixy editorial team (2024). “By
using this approach, companies cannot only keep away from seller lock-in
but also take advantage of the quality pricing, functions, and
infrastructure components to be had throughout cloud carriers.”</p>
<p>In conclusion, hopefully, the MCDM problems have been solved with
satisfactory solution. Moreover, the disaster recovery and cloud vendor
lock-in issues could be resolved.</p>

<p>TOPSIS as one of MCDM methods considers both the distance of each
alternative from the positive ideal and the distance of each alternative
from the negative ideal point. In other words, the best alternative
should have the shortest distance from the positive ideal solution (PIS)
and the longest distance from the negative ideal.</p>
<p>In this study there are 4 criteria and 5 alternatives that are ranked
based on TOPSIS method. The following table describes the criteria</p>
