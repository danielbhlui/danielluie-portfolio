									<p>The last assignment of this course requires me to reflect upon
critically the events as well as my learnings during this course.</p>
<p><strong>The Security and Risk Management process based on what you
have learned in this module</strong></p>
<p>If there is anything that I have learned during this course, it would
be the risk management process (i.e. Asset identification, Risk
analysis, Vulnerability identification, Probability and impact analysis
(qualitative and quantitative risk analysis), and Developing mitigation
strategies). After being repeatedly drilled into me by Mr. Necat, I
believe I can apply the process very satisfactorily to a given risk
situation. For example, I have been practicing to apply the risk
management framework to a couple of problems in this course.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also a lot of other things I have learned. Those
would be described in the last section of this paper.</p>
<p><strong>My individual contributions to the team
activities</strong></p>
<p>I am responsible for the following parts in the essay:</p>
<p>1c. A list of potential mitigations to the identified risks and
threats (for the stand-alone shop).</p>
<p>2b. A list of proposed changes that form the basis of the
digitalization process/ transformation</p>
<p>2e. A list of potential mitigations to the identified risks and
threats (for the digitalized shop).</p>
<p>Also, I serve as the coordinator and editor besides writing my parts.
Daniel Malok also edits.</p>
<p><strong>My experience as a member of a development team</strong></p>
<p>In our group project, we have been assigned to do a relatively short
risk identification report. I suppose due to the fact that it is
relatively short, it has not too much of pressure on us. In addition to
writing my part, I have taken the initiative to take on the coordinator
and editor roles. At the end of the project, one member of our team
actually thanks my leadership. I must say that makes my day. I also am
glad to report that there is no drama in this group, unlike some ugly
situations I have been through before. I suppose communication is the
key. Another thing that I have learned in group work is the need to
conduct proper time management. Some team members are clearly motivated
only when the deadline is looming, in order not to destroy rapport, I
can only give them a gentle push. That is another instance where good
communications are important right there.</p>
<p><strong>The impact on my professional/personal
development</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, I must admit 12 weeks have zoomed by just like that. If I
could do this course over again, I wish I could have performed tighter
grip on time management. I would definitely keep that in mind before my
next course, network security.</p>
<p>I have previously studied financial risk management (FRM). I have
been wondering if financial risk management and cybersecurity risk
management would be more like the same or different. It turns out they
are more different than similar and also the skill sets required are
very different. Although both rely to a big extent on qualitative and
quantitative methods, the contents and look and feels are very
different. Before taking this course, I have been naïve to think that
the two are vastly similar, boy, was I wrong? In FRM, the typical
scenario is to figure out whether a risk is too cheap or too expensive,
whereas in the cyber world, all risks are down side risks only and are
subject to risk management. Technical skills and commercial awareness
often go together.</p>
<p>In thread modeling, the students have learned a variety of techniques
such as STRIDE and PASTA. I must admit that it is news to me that there
is a security dimension towards software development. In undergraduate
computer science studies, I have been taught to make the program to
work, but was never told about this security aspect. So now that I feel
like it is like an eye opening for me to learn of this security aspect
in software engineering. I am pleased to learn of this important aspect
of security. From now on, I will take security seriously when writing a
program, if possible.</p>
<p>In unit 5, we have learned about the security and risk standards. I
am a little disappointed ISO 27000 and nist only got discussed in the
lecturecast, but not in the readings. Due to the requirements in the
Hong Kong job market, I would definitely want to know more about the
two. It is very important to be commercially aware if I want to obtain a
return on this degree.</p>
<p>In unit 7, we have been exposed to different quantitative methods and
their implementations. While I am not about to yell out loud that “math
is hard,” I must also acknowledge that quant really is the most
difficult component in this course. I am therefore glad that I have
found the resilience in me that makes me successful in travelling this
journey. The proof is that I have successfully completed the highly
quantitative individual assignment.</p>
<p>Before learning the skills taught in this course, I was dealing with
multicriteria decision making (MCDM) in a highly intuitive manner, which
could more likely let me to arrive at an incorrect decision. Now that I
have learned quantitative assessment and MCDM, I know that the decision
I make is more grounded on science and on more firmed footings.</p>
<p>In unit 9 and 10, we have learned about business continuity and
disaster recovery plans. I am thankful that the lecturecast has given me
the necessary information required (i.e. active-active) to successfully
complete the individual assignment. I have also performed adequate
critical thinking and analysis, as well as problem-solving in completing
the assignment. But without that one piece of information, it would be
very difficult for me to do well in that assignment, even if I have done
an extensive amount of research for that assignment.</p>
<p>In unit 11 and 12, we have learned about the trends and future of
cybersecurity risk management. To this student, it seems a little
remote. This is not to say that they are not important. Of course they
are. Just that they still seem a little speculative to me. Still, I must
say that I am aware more about the future trends in security management
after studying these two units.</p>
