									<p><strong>Summary Post #1 (Unit 3)</strong></p>
<p>According to the authors Kovaite, Sumakaris, Stankeviciene, and
Korsakiene (2019), Industry 4.0 represents “a new paradigm of global
technological developments in industry, society and business.” A number
of technological drivers such as IoT, big data and AI appears to have
big impact and disrupts on business models in almost any industry, which
makes “the physical and geographical boundaries of industry disappear”
and the new “opportunities in newly established supply chains provide
possibilities for SMEs to compete in international markets.”</p>
<p>With opening up of new opportunities there comes a number of risks,
especially cybersecurity risks. Firstly, “industrial espionage and
industrial sabotage are very real concerns for industries where
sensitive and proprietary data could be exposed or even destroyed.
Another example (of risks) is the deliberate disruption of manufacturing
processes by malicious hackers to cause damage to manufacturing
entities.” (Prinsloo, Sinha, and von Solms, 2019)</p>
<p>In terms of supports or contradictions the points made in the cited
study, Muller and Voigt (2018) finds that, for SMEs there exists a lower
perceived impact of the IIoT for their respective enterprise. Also,
Muller and Voigt expect that Industry 4.0 might be designed more towards
the requirements of larger enterprises. Its benefits therefore might be
harder to capture by SMEs.</p>
<p>Daniel Malok in his peer response argues that Industry 4.0 can
increase SMEs competitiveness in various ways. I welcome a contrary
viewpoint and I find it persuasive.</p>
<p>Mr Necat is concerned with the consequences of the widely use of IOT
devices; especially, the invasion of privacy. I accept there would be
likely invasion of privacy and it is up to the society to put in
effective controls to reduce risk of abuse to an acceptable level.</p>
<p>Tyrone Lim has provided good summaries of various authors’ viewpoints
and I accept them.</p>

<p><strong>Summary Post #2 (Unit 9)</strong></p>
<p>Spring and others (2021) are not holding back when they criticize
CVSS. Firstly, “the CVSS scoring algorithm is not justified, either
formally or empirically.” They believe the CVSS formula is not properly
justified and too many workarounds, temporary fix and other issues make
CVSS unusable. Secondly, the CVSS is not born being a risk score per se,
but is a vulnerability score. That in Spring and others’ eyes is a major
sin. And they write in length of the consequences of this as CVSS’
failure to account for context, failure to account for material
consequences of the vulnerability and being operational scoring
problems.</p>
<p>I agree with Spring and others that the CVSS formula is not justified
and I agree their suggestion that “adequate user studies should be
conducted to understand how organizations use CVSS in their risk
assessments today.” Also, I believe CVSS should be used as it is, a
vulnerability indicator and should not be used as a risk indicator, as
it has never intended to be.</p>
<p>This student believes that the alternative that will replace CVSS 3
would be CVSS 4.0. This is because in questionnaire and open feedback
comments as cited by Wunder and others, “users are aware of problems
associated with CVSS, but that these do not outweigh its advantages.
Over 70% clearly agreed to use CVSS in the future.”</p>
<p>I note Thomas Smith’s point that it is important to distinguish
between vulnerability and risk. It looks like many professionals are not
getting it.</p>
<p>I agree with Chi Ming that CVSS is not a failure. Far from it, I
think CVSS would be hanging around for a long time.</p>
