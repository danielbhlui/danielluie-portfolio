									<p><strong>Unit 02 Seminar</strong></p>
<p>Read the Spears &amp; Barki (2010) article then prepare answers to
the following questions:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>How did the authors use both Qualitative and Quantitative
assessment approaches? What benefits did each approach yield?</p></li>
<li><p>What do the authors list as the advantages of involving users in
the risk management process?</p></li>
<li><p>Based on the findings of the research,</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>How will the lack of user access affect the risk assessment you
will carry out as part of your assessment?</p></li>
<li><p>Will it affect the choice of Qualitative vs. Quantitative
assessment methods you utilise?</p></li>
<li><p>How might you mitigate any issues encountered?</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>You should demonstrate that you understand the topic covered and
ensure you use references to academic literature (including journals,
books, and reports). This activity will provide evidence of your
personal growth and is a component of the e-portfolio, which you can
submit at the end of the module.</p>
<p>We will review some of your answers in this week’s seminar, as well
as covering more on the content of Units 1 and 2. There will also be an
opportunity to review your team’s progress during the seminar.</p>
<p>My answer:</p>
<p>a. Qualitative method is used because of uncertainty of not knowing
enough of user participation in the context of SRM to use quantitative
method. “Thus, qualitative methods provided a rich understanding of the
activities, behaviors, and assignments that define user participation in
the context of SRM for regulatory compliance.” Quantitative methods were
then employed to test the theoretical model derived from the qualitative
study and based on the researchers' understanding.</p>
<p>b. “Users may be an important resource to IS security by providing
needed business knowledge that contributes to more effective security
measures. User participation is also a means to engage users in
protecting sensitive information in their business processes.”</p>
<p>c1. Users know about the businesses. Also, users are needed to
protect business secrets.</p>
<p>c2. Yes, it will affect the qualitative and quantitative methods we
utilize.</p>
<p>c3. We mitigate by bringing user participation as much and as early
as possible.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><strong>Unit 04 Seminar</strong></p>
<p>After scanning through the readings, I believe although probably not
as difficult as the quantitative methods, but this topic of threat
modeling is still probably kind of important.</p>

<p><strong>Unit 5 e-Portfolio Component</strong></p>
<p>3) Case Study 3: The Dublin Mint Office Limited</p>
<p>The DPC received a complaint on 13 October 2017 from an individual
who had received two marketing telephone calls that same day, one
targeted at him and one at his son, from The Dublin Mint Office Limited.
The caller in each case had attempted to sell commemorative coins. In
his complaint, the complainant explained that he had registered online a
few months earlier with the company for an online offer on his own
behalf and on behalf of his son, providing the same telephone contact
number for both of them during the online registration process. The
complainant stated that he ticked the marketing opt-out box during that
online registration process.</p>
<p>During the course of the DPC’s investigation, The Dublin Mint Office
Limited admitted that it had made the marketing telephone calls. It
explained that when the complainant supplied his telephone number during
the online application process in May 2017 the order form had only
offered an opt-in option to receive marketing mails and emails. The
company confirmed that the complainant had not selected the opt-in
option and he was therefore marked as opt-out for marketing mails and
emails only. The company explained that a gap in the system in place at
the time only allowed for an opt-in to marketing mails and emails but
that it was not an opt-out for telesales. As a result, the complainant’s
details were included in a list for a follow-up telesales call. The
company informed the DPC that it had written to the complainant to
apologise for the inconvenience caused to him and to his son by its
inadvertent mistake.</p>
<p>The DPC had previously issued a warning to The Dublin Mint Office
Limited in September 2017 concerning other complaints which had been
made to the DPC concerning unsolicited marketing communications by the
company. The DPC therefore decided to prosecute The Dublin Mint Office
Limited. At Dublin Metropolitan District Court on 14 May 2018 the
company pleaded guilty to two charges in relation to both marketing
telephone calls. It also agreed to cover the DPC’s prosecution costs. In
lieu of a conviction and fine, the Court applied Section 1(1) of the
Probation of Offenders Act.</p>
<p>e-Portfolio Activity – GDPR Case Studies</p>
<p>2018 Case Study 3: The Dublin Mint Office Limited</p>
<p>The specific aspect that GDPR addresses in this case is unsolicited
marketing communications.</p>
<p>The defendant, Dublin Mint Office Limited, admits to guilty as
charged and agreed to cover the DPC’s prosecution costs. The court
issued a probation.</p>
<p>Firstly, I would set up a Chinese Wall to separate the opt in and the
opt out. Secondly I would institute an improvement in quality control in
the software development team to come up with better software.</p>

<p><strong>Unit 08 Seminar</strong></p>
<p>Unit 8 Seminar questions</p>
<p>1. How do Goerlandt et al (2017) suggest that the validity of QRA
approaches can be validated? What did they posit was the most effective
approach?</p>
<p>2. Which techniques did Hugo et al (2018) should be applied to
project management? What were their recommendations to increase the use
of QR analysis in Projects?</p>
<p>3. The last paper reviews various Multi-Criteria Decision Methods
(MCDMs) and considered the relative accuracy and validity of the
techniques. Which did they find was the most accurate of the methods
compared? What were the failings of the general TOPSIS approach?</p>
<p>Answers:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The conceptual validity school defines 4 validity
criteria:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>V1. The degree to which the produced numbers are accurate compared to
the underlying true risk. V2. The degree to which the assigned
subjective probabilities adequately describe the assessor’s
uncertainties of the unknown quantities considered. V3. The degree to
which the epistemic uncertainty assessments are complete. V4. The degree
to which the analysis addresses the right quantities (ﬁctional
quantities or observable events).</p>
<p>In the scientific foundations school, risk realists believe risk is a
physical property that can be characterized by objective facts.</p>
<p>In the pragmatic validity of QRA school, the accuracy claim means
that the aggregate estimate of total system risk be sufficiently
accurate and precise to allow correct decision making. The
cost-effective usefulness claim suggests that performing QRA provides a
safety benefit. The usefulness claim means that the application of QRA
helps designers to make safer systems and/or decision makers to make
better decisions.</p>
<p>Goerlandt and others believes more research is needed is needed for
instance with respect to the effectiveness of the proposed methods for
the different identiﬁed uses of QRA, and which processes, techniques and
social structures support their successful application.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Hugo and others believe that project management tools and
schedule and cost management tools should be applied to project
management.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>With regards to their recommendations to increase the use of QR
analysis in Projects, they recommend that:</p>
<p>a. Improve individuals’ risk management competence via training,
exposure, etc.</p>
<p>b. Align the parent organization’s approach to risk management with
projects, and strive to improve the organization’s maturity levels in
project and risk management processes.</p>
<p>c. Make available the required resources, both human and software, to
carry out risk management, both for qualitative and quantitative risk
management.</p>
<p>3. According to Çelikbilek and Tüysüz, AHP and MOORA are much more
accurate and valid technique.</p>
<p>There are 3 criticisms to TOPSIS, the first is the rank reversal
phenomenon which is valid for AHP and TOPSIS methods. Rank reversal is
related to the change in the ranking of alternatives when a criterion or
an alternative is added or dropped. Another important criticism is about
the ranking index of the TOPSIS. Another criticism or disadvantage of
the TOPSIS is related to the correlation between criteria. Since the
TOPSIS method uses Euclidean distance, which does not take into
consideration the correlation, the results are affected due to the
information overlap.</p>

<p><strong>Unit 10 Seminar</strong></p>
<p>Title: DR Solutions Design and Review</p>
<p>The following is my notes preparing for the seminar:</p>
<p>A1 limited possibility to interoperate with other cloud systems.</p>
<p>Vendor lock-in problem in cloud computing is characterized by
expensive and time-consuming migration of application and data to
alternative providers. Cloud software vendors lock in customers in
several ways: (1) by designing a system incompatible with software
developed by other vendors; (2) by using proprietary standards or closed
architectures that lack interoperability with other applications; (3) by
licensing the software under exclusive conditions customers have voiced
their concerns about the inconvenience of moving applications and</p>
<p>data from one cloud to another</p>
<p>to mitigate</p>
<p>the first and foremost step required to ensure cloud service
portability is the standardization of the data formats used by service
providers.</p>
<p>Lack of Standards Creates Barriers to Cloud Entry. Standards are
regularly proposed as a way to mitigate vendor lock-in. Cloud users
would particularly welcome standards that address workload migration and
data migration use cases because such standards would mitigate vendor
lock-in concerns.</p>

<p><strong>Unit 12 Seminar</strong></p>
<p>The Trend of Increasing awareness of the importance of cybersecurity
in the higher level of organizations</p>
<p>In the US, there is increased board of directors’ involvement on the
issue of cybersecurity because of the increased penalty associated with
the lack of actions dealing with cybersecurity.</p>
<p>In the US in 2022, there were 83% of companies suffered from multiple
data breaches, with the average expense of $9.44 million. It represents
a 600% over the past ten years. The cost of cybersecurity incidents to
companies and investors was rising at an increasing rate. The financial
impact of data breaches on organizations has increased by 15 percent in
the past three years. (kovrr.com)</p>
<p>A recent rule was passed on July 26, 2023 by the Security and
Exchange Commission to require publicly traded US companies and other
private issuers to report “material cybersecurity incidents” within four
days of positively identifying an event. These companies also are
required to make annual disclosures describing their cybersecurity
governance and the impacts of previous incidents. (sec.gov)</p>
<p>The rule went into effect late last year and gave a boost to
cybersecurity risk management practices in companies by increasing
accountability and protecting investors better by ensuring they are
aware of risk exposure.</p>
<p>In the EU, there is a NIS2 directive that outlines more explicitly
corporate responsibility. It aims to achieve a high common level of
cybersecurity across the European Union. To comply with the new
Directive, organizations must take measures to minimize cyber risks.
These measures include incident management, stronger supply chain
security, enhanced network security, better access control, and
encryption. The directive primarily affects large companies.</p>
<p>Recently, Australian Securities and Investments Commission chairman
Joe Longo warned boards of the penalties should they fail to make
reasonable investments in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>To summarize, boards of directors in many countries are increasingly
aware of cybersecurity and the penalties of not taking care of it in
their companies.</p>
